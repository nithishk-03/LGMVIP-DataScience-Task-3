# LGMVIP-DataScience-Task-3

**Overview**
This project involves time series forecasting using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The goal is to predict future values based on historical data, specifically forecasting the next 30 days using the last 100 days of data as input. The project includes model development, prediction generation, and various visualizations to analyze the forecasted results.

**Objectives**
Model Development: Build and train an LSTM model for time series forecasting.
Prediction Generation: Forecast the next 30 days of data based on historical values.
Visualization: Create different plots to visualize and interpret the forecasted values.
